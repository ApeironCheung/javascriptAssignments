<h1>Welcome to my first website!</h1>
<h2>My name is Pak Hang CHEUNG</h2>
<p>I know EECS 1012 is a chllenging course, and I need to <i>engage</i> really well 
    in problem sloving activities from the <strong>first</strong> week of classes every week. </p>
<p>I have been told that if I treat 1012, 1022, 2030 and 2011 each as 6 credit course, 
    and really learn the underlying concepts and skills, I will enjoy rest of my EECS programs.
In fact <u>rest of my life! as long as I am in the EECS business.</u> </p>
